## Hi there 👋

I’m a software developer who uses Python as one of my main tools.

My goal is simple: improving people’s lives through technology.

Developing software has been a very real dream for me.  
It’s something that truly changes lives — starting back in childhood, building small projects with simple robots, growing into Arduino experiments, and now being able to use everything I’ve learned to create real solutions that make a difference.

I’m constantly learning new languages and tools to build, shape, and solve problems.

Today, I apply this mindset by automating tasks and processes, including work on the ServiceNow platform using JavaScript, as well as working with databases and SQL concepts when needed.

I believe good software is not just about code — it’s about saving time, reducing friction, and helping people focus on what truly matters.

I hope something you find here helps you in some way.
